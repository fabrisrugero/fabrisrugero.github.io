                <div class="textcontainer">
                    <p class="text">Nobody knows why out of all the file formats they decide to choose  to incorporate mpeg file extension into the name of one of today's most powerful, comprehensive and free software suite. FFmpeg is so powerful that it's used by today's tech giants such as Apple.Inc which incorporates FFmpegs libraries into it's itunes, Google.Inc which use Ffmpegs libraries to process hundreds of thousands of videos that are uploaded to YouTube everyday. Even other popular free software suites such as VLC media player also incorporates FFmpegs' libraries. It's save to say that if you look close/deep enough at any video manipulation software suite today. You will find traces of FFmpegs. </p>
                    <p class="text">What makes FFmpegs so powerful is it's codec suite. What is a codec? A codec is any device or software that that takes a stream of data and transforms/codes it into another type of data that is compressed and thus easier to store as it's much smaller than the original data. However; the data is useless in that state in order to mean anything it needs to be decoded/reversed by the same device/software that coded/transformed it back into it's original form for playback. There are thousands of this codecs out there all with the pluses and minuses.</p>
                    <p class="text">For example one codec might be extremely good at compression thus producing small files for storage at the cost of quality loss whilst another codec produces larger storage files but with little quality loss. Finally; the word codec is the combination of code (co-) and decode (-dec). FFmpeg makes it easy to trans-code or literally speaking move between codecs. This simply means you can take a file that was produced from one codec and convert it into another codec. If a codec exits, you can bet the house that FFmpegs knows about. </p>

                <h2 class="sectionh2">Early adoption of FFMPEG and uses</h2>
                <div class="textcontainer">
                    <p class="text">Mr Fabrice Bellard started the FFmpeg project eighteen years ago, almost two decades ago. The first notable early adopter was YouTube back in twenty ten or twenty twelve. They poured their own resources ( two employees) into the project and in a span of two years were able two eliminate over one thousand bugs. The project has since then grown into big community and releases new versions of the software with new features roughly every three months. On the left you will see some FFmpegs versions ( from latest to earliest) and the pet names associated with them. If you follow the link to their website you will see more details  and features for that particular version.</p>
