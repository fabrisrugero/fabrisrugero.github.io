                <h3>What version of FFmpeg should I download?</h3>
                <div id="override001">
                    <p>It is highly recommended that you use the latest version. This is because along the way to the latest FFmpeg version lots of bugs have been found and fixed. It's also worth remebering that if you going to use FFmpeg in your own application, FFmpeg will stop supporting certain versions if they become to old therefore you don't what to be in a situation where you stuck with a mulfunction version which thousands of lines of code depend and will have to be modified to conform to the new feature of newer versions so it's recommended you choose the latest stable versions. Google arround before you download.</p>

                <h3>What is FFprobe and FFplay?</h3>
                <div id="override002">
                    <p>FFplay is pretty much similar to any other media playback software like VLC or itunes. But it's barebones and has virtual no GUI ( graphical user interface ) it's activated via the command line just like FFmpeg. FFprobe basically does what it's name states it's use to probe the metaData of a media file. This is useful if the file is corrupted and is unreadable by convetionaly playback software.</p>
